      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I prototyped an aiding device to standardize weighted squat jumps for training and rehab with controls for depth and tempo and optional sensor logging.</p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>SolidWorks for CAD and drawings</li>
        <li>3D printing for rapid iteration</li>
        <li>Microcontroller platform for optional sensing</li>
        <li>Excel for performance logs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>Embedded Systems and Mechanical Designer</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I modeled the mechanism, built test fixtures, and tuned geometry for safe, repeatable motion. I explored displacement and velocity sensing and created an export to Excel for rep tracking. The design keeps cost low and allows future upgrades such as closed-loop control or wireless dashboards. The goal is to improve training consistency and rehab outcomes through guided mechanics and basic instrumentation.</p>
