      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I designed and implemented a city simulation in Java to explore how agents migrate through a grid-based environment 
        based on satisfaction, crowding, and fairness. Each agent represents a resident evaluating their surroundings to 
        decide whether to stay, move, or relocate.

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Java (object-oriented design)</li>
        <li>Gradle (build automation)</li>
        <li>JUnit (testing)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The simulation used modular classes for agents, buildings, walkways, and time tracking. I implemented a two-step 
        update system to ensure consistency in agent decision-making across the grid. Agents evaluated satisfaction thresholds, 
        reset conditions, and density limits when deciding whether to move. I integrated Gradle for build automation and 
        JUnit to test movement logic and system stability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To analyze outcomes, I built custom TimeSeries objects to track agent behavior and placement over time, which revealed 
        emergent patterns such as congestion and clustering. This project showed how local decision-making scales into large 
        system behavior — a concept directly relevant to distributed systems, smart city planning, and load balancing.
