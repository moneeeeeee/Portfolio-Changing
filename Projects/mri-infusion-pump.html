      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>We built a non-ferrous infusion pump for MRI environments using 3D-printed parts and stepper-based syringe actuation, with pressure sensing and feedback control.</p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>SolidWorks for mechanical design and drawings</li>
        <li>3D printing for PLA components</li>
        <li>MPX5010 sensor with Wheatstone bridge and instrumentation amplifier</li>
        <li>Arduino control with data streaming to Excel, MATLAB and Python for analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>Embedded Systems Developer and Mechanical Designer</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I integrated a differential pressure sensor and built a feedback loop that compares live readings to a potentiometer-defined target. The controller adjusts plunger motion to hold pressure within tight bounds and handles faults such as occlusions. We simulated circuits in TinkerCAD before lab tests and documented requirements, interfaces, and test plans for traceability.</p>
      <p>The design supports MRI-guided procedures and research that needs precise fluid delivery near a magnet. I strengthened skills in embedded sensing, mechanical actuation, and verification under constraints.</p>
